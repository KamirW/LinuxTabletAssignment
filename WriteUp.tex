\label{chapter: Installing Linux onto a Tablet}

# This is the basic overview section... delete this small comment at the end

It is commonly known that tablets are like bigger versions of android phones. And an android phone is just like a small computer. So, following that string of logic, a tablet would then 
just be a bigger computer than an android. With that being the case, is it then possible to put a computer operating system onto a tablet? Well, the short answer is yes, but it is certainly 
no easy feat. This chapter will cover the steps to loading a different operating system onto a tablet, the barriers of such a task, and also the shortcomings and advantages to doing such 
a thing.
